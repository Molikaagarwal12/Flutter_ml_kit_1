//BARCODE SCANNER...

// 1..The code is a Flutter application that utilizes the camera feed to perform barcode scanning using the
// google_mlkit_barcode_scanning package.
//
// 2..The main() function initializes the Flutter application, retrieves the available cameras using the camera package,
//     and runs the CameraScreen widget as the root of the application.
//
// 3..The _CameraScreenState class is the main state for the camera screen. It initializes the camera controller and barcode scanner,
// and sets up the camera feed using the CameraPreview widget.
//
// 4..The doBarCodeScanning() function processes each frame from the camera feed and performs barcode scanning using the barCodeScanner
// object. The detected barcodes are stored in the barcodes list, and the result is displayed on the screen.
//
// 5..The getInputImage() function prepares the camera frame for barcode scanning by converting it into an InputImage object.
// It extracts the necessary data from the img variable, such as bytes, image size, rotation, and format.

//SMART REPLY APPLICATION...

// 1..The code is a Flutter application that demonstrates the usage of the google_mlkit_smart_reply package.
// It provides a user interface for sending and receiving messages and generates smart reply suggestions based on the received messages.
//
// 2..The SmartReply class from the google_mlkit_smart_reply package is used to handle smart reply functionality.
// It is initialized in the initState() method of the _MyHomePageState class.
//
// 3..The user interface consists of two text input fields, one for the received message and another for the sender's message.
// The received message is added to the conversation using smartReply.addMessageToConversationFromRemoteUser(),
// and the sender's message is added using smartReply.addMessageToConversationFromLocalUser(). When the user taps the send button,
// the code calls smartReply.suggestReplies() to generate smart reply suggestions based on the conversation history.
// The suggestions are displayed in the UI.

//TEXT TRANSLATION...

// 1...The code demonstrates text translation in a Flutter application using on-device translation models from the google_mlkit_translation package.
// It allows users to enter text, select source and target languages, and displays the translated text.
//
// 2...The code utilizes the OnDeviceTranslatorModelManager class to manage translation models and the LanguageIdentifier class to identify
// the language of the input and translated text. It ensures that the necessary translation models are downloaded and
// enables language identification functionality.

// IMAGE LABELLING ....

// 1..The code showcases a Flutter application that utilizes the device's 'camera to perform real-time image labeling using the
// google_mlkit_image_labeling package. It captures camera frames, processes them using the ML Kit image labeling API,
//     and displays the identified labels with their confidence scores.
//
// 2..The code initializes the camera controller and sets up the image labeling functionality. It uses the ImageLabeler class with
// specified options to configure the confidence threshold for label detection. The captured camera frames are continuously processed,
// and the results are updated on the screen in real-time.
//
// 3..The getInputImage() function prepares the camera image frames for processing by converting them into an InputImage object,
// which is required by the image labeling API. It extracts the necessary information from the camera image, such as pixel data, size,
// rotation, and format, and constructs the InputImage accordingly.
// The doImageLabelling() function processes the input image using the image labeling API and extracts the detected labels and their
// confidence scores. The results are displayed on the screen using the result variable.
